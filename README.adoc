= JPA Sample 

This is a Spring Boot Application that uses JPA to persist data to
a data store.

The current POM is sets the parent to use Spring Boot 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.  This will fail with the following exception:

```
 java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Not a managed type: class io.spring.configuration.TaskRunOutput
```

If you change the parent to Spring Boot 2.6.2, the sample builds and works.
